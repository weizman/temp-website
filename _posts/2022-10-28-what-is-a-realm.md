title: What Is A Realm In JS?
---

Couldn't find a proper explanation on what realms are in JS so decided to come up with one myself (https://weizman.github.io/page-what-is-a-realm-in-js/).
I recommend you give this a read - this is a concept you should be familiar with to consider yourself someone who's above average in understanding JS!
