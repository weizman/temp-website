## My reply to Shubham Shah's tweet on whether client side security even matters

Not too long ago, the well known security researcher [Shubham Shah](https://shubs.io/) wrote the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the first 3-4 years that i was working in infosec, I found client side security so exciting. I stayed on top of every new technique and studied new techniques closely. After this, I took a step back and realised that all of my work on client side security felt helpless,â€¦</p>&mdash; shubs (@infosec_au) <a href="https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/1698322940159557987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And to me this was magical, because Shubham - like a good security researcher - managed to press some of my weak points pretty accurately.
Truth be told, I've being brewing with similar feelings for long periods of time throughout my career, and I still do. 
To this day I battle my strong desire and pure passion for the field of client side security with rational thoughts and the understandable wish for a long, stable and thriving career as an individual in the tech industry.

Shubham's tweet made me realize that the fact that this dilema had taken me through multiple emotional rides throughout my career already, had got to the point where it's time to digest it and self-reflect it, in terms of its relationship with the cyber security industry, the importance of its role in the ecosystem, and its future.

To me, that usually means to write. Writing helps me clear my head and put my thoughts in order. In regards with the client side security industry, it's time to do just that - so buckle up.

### Shubham's tweet

So first of all, what's all the fuzz about? 

For context, Shubham is a security researcher with a lot of experience, both with vulnerability research and with application security.
And from his tweet, it seems that his vast experience with application security had made him understand that when applications were suffering from security breaches, it was almost always the responsibility of components that aren't the client side:

> "_I analysed the reasons companies faced great hardship, and most of the time it was not because of client side security issues but rather server side issues that led to critical impact on their infrastructure._"

Shubham made me connect to his experience by expressing a similar passion he had out of hope and belief (almost self convincment?) that securing the client side is truly important, until it failed to hold water against logic and reality:

> _"For the first 3-4 years that i was working in infosec, I found client side security so exciting. I stayed on top of every new technique and studied new techniques closely. After this, I took a step back and realised that all of my work on client side security felt helpless, useless, to some extent. "_

As a security expert, responsible of auditing the security of applications by naturally going after the most impact apps can go under, Shubham had to shift his efforts towards other areas than the client side:

> _"A part of me thought that client side security issues still had impact to the end users (and they still do), but I couldn't cite a single example where a company had lost so much due to a client side issue. It really shaped my mindset and perspective for what to be looking for when auditing an application, and is the reason why I became so deeply invested in server side security."_

But what really got me, was the fear of ever saying the following words:

> _"I still try and stay on top of client side security exploitation techniques, but they don't really excite me any more."_

Because knowing the industry and relating to Shubham sees things, I can see myself ending up in a similar place.
And I take this harder than Shubham maybe, because of the relationship I have with client side security, for better or worse.

### My relationship with client side security

#### Buckle up

As an 18yo Israeli, I was to serve the Israeli Defense Forces by duty. There are many different roles to take as part of this obligation, and the intelligent and/or fortunate ones serve in the Israeli Intelligence Corps, a batch of units which are mostly responsible for collecting valuable intel for national security. The most impactful way for achieving that is by practicing what you might know as "Offensive Cyber Security", which is a primary reason why Israel is considered to be a world class leader in cyber security.

The most popular one, which I ended up at, is called 8200.

If truth to be told, on that spectrum between intelligent and fortunate, I was probably a lot closer to fortunate than intelligent.
The proof of that was the fact that the professionality gap between the training course I was accepted to and the team I ended up in was the result of no less than an accident (a story for anoter day).

Naturally, such a gap intrdocued significant difficulties for me, as I struggled a lot to keep up with the rest of the team. I was surrounded by highly competent invdividuals, which became highly skilled in each of their own distinct field of expertise, whereas I was a colorless weak link. It was no picnic.

After a year and a half of doing mostly QA and struggling to learn Python, it was decided that our team should take some extra responsibility by absorbing a security field that belonged to another team, meaning no one in my team were familiar with that field - Browser JavaScript (offensive) Security.

Being the perfect opportunity for me to take on something that is not only a bigger contribution to the joint effort than the things I've done so far, but most importantly a chance for me to find my own color and to become an expert in a field no one else (in my team) is - I jumped on it immediately.

And so began the bumpiest ride I had ever taken (and still am).

#### The ride of my life

Been a decade since then, a decade of multiple ups and downs.

### Forever bumpy(?)
