## My reply to Shubham Shah's tweet on whether client side security still matters

Not too long ago, the well known security researcher [Shubham Shah](https://shubs.io/) wrote the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the first 3-4 years that i was working in infosec, I found client side security so exciting. I stayed on top of every new technique and studied new techniques closely. After this, I took a step back and realised that all of my work on client side security felt helpless,â€¦</p>&mdash; shubs (@infosec_au) <a href="https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/1698322940159557987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And to me this was magical, because Shubham - like a good security researcher - managed to press some of my weak points pretty accurately.
Truth be told, I've being brewing with similar feelings for long periods of time throughout my career, and I still do. 
To this day I battle my strong desire and pure passion for the field of client side security with rational thoughts and the understandable wish for a long, stable and thriving career as an individual in the tech industry.

Shubham's tweet made me realize that the fact that this dilema had taken me through multiple emotional rides throughout my career already, had got to the point where it's time to digest it and self-reflect it, in terms of its relationship with the cyber security industry, the importance of its role in the ecosystem, and its future.

To me, that usually means to write. Writing helps me clear me head and put my thoughts in order. In regards with the client side security industry - it's time to do just that.

So first of all, what's all the fuzz about?
