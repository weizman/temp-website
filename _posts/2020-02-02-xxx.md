## My reply to Shubham Shah's tweet on whether client side security even matters

Not too long ago, the well known security researcher [Shubham Shah](https://shubs.io/) wrote the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the first 3-4 years that I was working in infosec, I found client side security so exciting. I stayed on top of every new technique and studied new techniques closely. After this, I took a step back and realised that all of my work on client side security felt helpless,â€¦</p>&mdash; shubs (@infosec_au) <a href="https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/1698322940159557987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And to me this was magical, because Shubham - like a good security researcher - managed to press some of my weak points pretty accurately.
Truth be told, I've being brewing with similar feelings for long periods of time throughout my career, and I still do. 
To this day I battle my strong desire and pure passion for the field of client side security with rational thoughts and the understandable wish for a long, stable and thriving career as an individual in the tech industry.

Shubham's tweet made me realize that the fact that this dilemma had taken me through multiple emotional rides throughout my career already, had got to the point where it's time to digest it and self-reflect it, in terms of its relationship with the cyber security industry, the importance of its role in the ecosystem, and its future.

To me, that usually means to write. Writing helps me clear my head and put my thoughts in order. In regards with the client side security industry, it's time to do just that - so buckle up.

### Shubham's tweet

So first of all, what's all the fuzz about? 

For context, Shubham is a security researcher with a lot of experience, both with vulnerability research and with application security.
And from his tweet, it seems that his vast experience with application security had made him understand that when applications were suffering from security breaches, it was almost always the responsibility of components that aren't the client side:

> "_I analysed the reasons companies faced great hardship, and most of the time it was not because of client side security issues but rather server side issues that led to critical impact on their infrastructure._"

Shubham made me connect to his experience by expressing a similar passion he had out of hope and belief (almost self convincement?) that securing the client side is truly important, until it failed to hold water against logic and reality:

> _"For the first 3-4 years that i was working in infosec, I found client side security so exciting. I stayed on top of every new technique and studied new techniques closely. After this, I took a step back and realised that all of my work on client side security felt helpless, useless, to some extent. "_

As a security expert, responsible for auditing the security of applications by naturally going after the most impact apps can go under, Shubham had to shift his efforts towards other areas than the client side:

> _"A part of me thought that client side security issues still had impact to the end users (and they still do), but I couldn't cite a single example where a company had lost so much due to a client side issue. It really shaped my mindset and perspective for what to be looking for when auditing an application, and is the reason why I became so deeply invested in server side security."_

But what really got me, was the fear of ever saying the following words:

> _"I still try and stay on top of client side security exploitation techniques, but they don't really excite me anymore."_

### My relationship with client side security

Because knowing the industry and relating to Shubham sees things, I can see myself ending up in a similar place.
And I take this harder than Shubham maybe, because of the relationship I have with client side security, for better or worse.

#### Buckle up

As an 18yo Israeli, I was to serve the Israeli Defense Forces by duty. There are many roles to take as part of this obligation, and the intelligent and/or fortunate ones serve in the Israeli Intelligence Corps, a batch of units which are mostly responsible for collecting valuable intel for national security. The most impactful way for achieving that is by practicing what you might know as "Offensive Cyber Security", which is a primary reason why Israel is considered to be a world class leader in cyber security.

The most popular one, which I ended up at, is called 8200.

If truth to be told, on that spectrum between intelligent and fortunate, I was probably a lot closer to fortunate than intelligent.
The proof of that was the fact that the professionality gap between the training course I was accepted to and the team I ended up in was the result of no less than an accident (a story for another day).

Naturally, such a gap introduced significant difficulties for me, as I struggled a lot to keep up with the rest of the team. I was surrounded by highly competent individuals, which became highly skilled in each of their own distinct field of expertise, whereas I was a colorless weak link. It was no picnic.

After a year and a half of doing mostly QA and struggling to learn Python, it was decided that our team should take some extra responsibility by absorbing a security field that belonged to another team, meaning no one in my team were familiar with that field - Browser JavaScript (offensive) Security.

Being the perfect opportunity for me to take on something that is not only a bigger contribution to the joint effort than the things I've done so far, but most importantly a chance for me to find my own color and to become an expert in a field no one else (in my team) is - I jumped on it immediately.

And so began the bumpy ride I of mine I call career.

#### The ride of my life

One decade forward, and I've been focusing almost entirely on JavaScript security. Working for the best in the field, I've gained experience in almost all clientside 
security fields one can imagine - whether it's 
[vulnerability research](https://weizmangal.com/?tags=CVEs), 
[anti debugging](https://weizmangal.com/?tags=Anti-Debug), 
[web extensions security](https://weizmangal.com/?tags=MetaMask), 
bot detection, 
[supply chain security](https://weizmangal.com/?tags=Supply-Chain-Security) or 
[JavaScript security](https://weizmangal.com/2021/07/18/securely-snow-across/).

While fun for the most part, the ride was bumpy because for some parts of it I was unsure of whether focusing so much on clientside security is a smart move.
Taking such an active part of this industry, I learned (the hard way) that this is a niche industry, and while you might feel pretty wanted by some companies,
such skills won't serve you similarly for the big amount of the others.

Leaving [PerimeterX](https://perimeterx.com/) (now [Human](https://www.humansecurity.com/)), I wanted to move on to the offensive cyber-security industry to advance my
vulnerability research and exploitation skills 
(right after finding a [major breach in WhatsApp Desktop](https://weizmangal.com/2020/02/14/whatsapp-vuln/) and a [CSP bypass in Chromium](https://weizmangal.com/2020/09/02/csp-vuln/)).

After learning more about this industry, combined with personal choices, I changed my mind and decided to pass on this industry, which got me to think - _if not this, what then?_

#### The wrong choice?

This was 3 months turbulence of emotions around the fear of whether I wasted the most important years of my career on this one niece filed no one has any interest of?

I mean, being a security pro is great, the need for security specialists isn't going to end anytime soon, especially in popular fields such as cloud security.
Same goes for JavaScript - being a pro in JS and an excellent JS engineer is also a safe bet as JS is still the most popular programming language in the world.

But a strict combination of the two? Perhaps too small of a cell in the tech industry matrix of needed skills.

As part of this roller coaster I was fortunate enough to consult great people I look up to on the matter. 
One of them was [Bionic](https://bionic.ai/)'s co-founder (acquired by [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)) [Eyal Mamo](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/eyal-mamo) 
which I got to know from the military service.

Eyal clearly understood where I was coming from and agreed I should broaden my horizons so that my perspective on security is wider, even if just slightly.

And that's how I joined Bionic for a standard FullStack software development position - a very different one from what I've been focusing on before - out of belief
fully betting on clientside security might not be the smartest thing to do.

And while Bionic turned out to be a great experience (both for working there and for it to be later acquired), 
I left Bionic only 1.5 years later - because the passion for clientside security didn't die off, it just went stronger. 

### Forever bumpy(?)
