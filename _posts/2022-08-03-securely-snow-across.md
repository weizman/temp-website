Excited to join [MetaMask](https://github.com/metamask) to work on high level js security initiatives such as [LavaMoat](https://github.com/lavamoat).

As part of me joining the organization I am bringing with me 3 cutting edge libraries I invented and worked on for the past year, to help fight against 
the problem of unwanted code execution in the browser.
